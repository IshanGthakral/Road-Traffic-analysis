# 🚦 Accident Data Analysis Dashboard | Power BI Project

This repository showcases a Power BI dashboard designed to analyze traffic accident data, uncover high-risk locations, track severity trends, and support data-driven road safety improvements.

## 📊 Project Overview

The aim of this project is to empower decision-makers with a clear and interactive overview of accident patterns using advanced visualization techniques in Power BI. The dashboard helps identify:

- 🚧 **Accident Hotspots**  
- 📈 **Severity Trends Over Time**  
- ⚠️ **Contributing Factors** such as weather, time of day, and road conditions

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Power BI**
  - Power Query for data transformation
  - DAX for calculated metrics and interactivity
  - Power BI Maps for geospatial visualization
- **Excel** (for initial data preprocessing)
- **SQL** (optional, for querying large datasets before importing into Power BI)

---

## 📍 Key Features

- **Interactive Map Visuals:**  
  Easily identify accident-prone areas with geospatial analysis.

- **Trend Analysis:**  
  View patterns in accident frequency and severity across different time periods.

- **Dynamic Filtering:**  
  Filter data by time, location, severity, weather, and other dimensions.

- **Insight Panels:**  
  Highlight critical safety insights for quick decision-making.

## 🧪 Data Insights

The dashboard provides actionable insights including:
- Top accident-prone areas (by district or region)
- Most common causes of severe accidents
- Time slots with the highest accident frequency
- Trends in accident severity over months/years

---

## 🎯 Future Improvements

- Integrate live accident data sources via APIs.
- Add predictive analytics using Python (optional with Power BI).
- Create an embedded web version using Power BI Service.
